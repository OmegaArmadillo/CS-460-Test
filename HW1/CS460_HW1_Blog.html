CS460 Project 1: Basic Webpage Creation
</div>



	<div>

	This page contains information about my Project 1.
	<br>The purposes of this project was to do things like learn how to create a repository, learn how to interact with the repository using the command line, create a webpage with html and css along with using Bootstrap.
	<br>We also had a list of requirments for our webpage.
	<br>For my website I had the idea of creating a website for a traveling agency.
	<br>The pages I created included a home page, a page that shows different locations, and a page that shows the travel rates.
	<br>

			Creating the Repository
		</div>
This part required me to create a GitHub repository and learn how to do things such as being able add and commit files from the command line.
<br> At first I used this <a href = "https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line"> page </a> to learn how to start.
<br> I then followed these steps.
	<ol>
		<li>Created a new repository manually in GitHub.</li>
		<li>Used the command <code>git init</code> to initialize the repository in the correct folder.</li>
		<li>Used the command <code>git add .</code> to add the files to stage them for commiting.</li>
		<li>Used the command <code>git commit -m "First commit" </code> to commit the files that I staged.</li>
		<li>Found my repository's url in the setup page of my repository. (https://omegaarmadillo.github.io/CS-460-Test/)</li>
		<li>Used the command <code>git remote add origin https://omegaarmadillo.github.io/CS-460-Test/</code> to set a new remote.</li>
		<li>Used the command <code>git remote -v</code> to verify the remote.</li>
		<li>Finally I used the command <code>git push origin master</code> to push the code to the repository.</li>
	</ol>
 I also learned about the uses of the pull command.
<br> I had to use it after I had edited and deleted some files in my repository and tried to push files. 	
<br> I then got the error "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you donot have locally". 
<br> After I got this error I did some research and learned I had to use <code>git pull origin master</code> to fix the issue before I could push to the repository.

			Creating the Webpage
		</div>
	
		For this part there were these were the things that were required
		<ol>
			<li>You must use Bootstrap (v4) for the layout of all pages and must demonstrate both single column layout and two or more column formatting</li>
			<li>You must have a separate CSS file (e.g. styles.css) in which you write some of your own classes and that you use somewhere</li>
			<li>You'll need a navigation bar or menu that contains links to all your pages</li>
			<li>You need to have at least one table and at least two kinds of lists: ol, ul and dl</li>
		</ol>

		<div class = "hwSubTitle">
		1. Implementing Bootstrap
		</div>
		To implement Bootstrap I had to add this code to the webpage.
		<br> <code> &#60; link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T" crossorigin="anonymous" &#62; </code>
	</p>

	<p>

		<div class = "hwSubTitle">
	<br>	2. Have a seperate CSS file for styles and create your own classes
		</div>
		
		This part was relatively simple.
		<br> I started by creating a css file called HW1.css
		<br> For each page I added <code>	&#60; link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="CSS\HW1.css" &#62; </code> to link the style sheet to the page.
		<br> Here are some examples of the classes I created.
		
		
		<div class = "codeBox">
		
			<div class  = "blue">*</div>
			{
			<div class = "code">
				
				
				<span class = "blue">font-family:</span> "Palatino";
				
			</div>
			}



		<br> <span class = "blue">a</span>:<span class = "red">visited</span>
		<br>{
		  <div class = "code">
		  <span class = "blue">color:</span> white;
			</div>
		}

		<br>.<span class = "red">titleBox</span>
		<br>{
			<div>
			 <span class = "blue">color:</span> white;
			<br><span class = "blue">font-size</span> 50px;
			<br><span class = "blue">background-color</span> MediumBlue;
			<br><span class = "blue">width</span> 100%;
			</div>
		}
	</div>

	</p>
	
	<p>
	
		<div class = "hwSubTitle">
		<br>	3. Create a navigation bar
		</div>
	
		For this I decided to use an unordered list as a navigation bar so i could fufill two requirements.
		<br>This is my code

	<div class = "codeBox">	

		
		
	<div >		<span class = "blue">&#60;div</span> <span class = "red">class</span> = <span class = "blue">"navMenu"&#62; </div> </span>
	<div class = "code">	<span class = "blue">&#60;ul</span> <span class = "red">class</span> = <span class = "blue">"navMenuList"&#62;<span> </div>
		
	<div class = "code">		<span class = "blue">&#60;li</span> <span class = "red">class</span> = <span class = "blue">"navMenuListItem"&#62; &#60;a</span> <span class = "red">href</span> = <span class = "blue">"HW1_Sights.html"&#62;</span> Sights <span class = "blue">&#60;/a&#62; &#60;/li&#62;</span> </div>
	<div class = "code">		<span class = "blue">&#60;li</span> <span class = "red">class</span> = <span class = "blue">"navMenuListItem"&#62; &#60;a</span> <span class = "red">href</span> = <span class = "blue">"HW1_Rates.html"&#62;</span> Rates <span class = "blue">&#60;/a&#62; &#60;/li&#62;</span> </div>
			
	<div class = "code">	<span class = "blue">&#60;/ul&#62;</span> </div>
		
		
	<div>	<span class = "blue">&#60;/div&#62;</span> </div>
		
		
		</div>

	<br>These are the styles I created
	<div class = "codeBox">
	
	.<span class = "red">navMenu</span>
	<br>{
	<br><span class = "blue">text-align:</span> center;
	<br><span class = "blue">color:</span> white;
	<br><span class = "blue">background-color:</span> GoldenRod;
	<br><span class = "blue">height:</span> 40px;
	<br>}



	<br>.<span class = "red">navMenuList</span>
	<br>{

	<br><span class = "blue">list-style-type:</span> none;
	
	<br>}


	<br>.<span class = "red">navMenuListItem</span>
	<br>{
	<br><span class = "blue">float:</span> left;
	<br><span class = "blue">margin:</span>0 0 0 50px;
	<br><span class = "blue">font-size:</span> 20px;
	<br>}
	
	
	
	</div>

	<br>I decided to use this many classes so I could have a wide range of control when creating the website.
	<br>I found that using a list was easier than making a bunch of divs as I din't have to worry about messing with the width of each of the divs.
	<br>All I had to do was use the float:left to achieve a similiar look.
	<br>

		<br>	4. Table and ordered list
		</div>
