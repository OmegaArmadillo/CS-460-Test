CS460 Project 1: Basic Webpage Creation
</div>



	<div>

	This page contains information about my Project 1.
	<br>The purposes of this project was to do things like learn how to create a repository, learn how to interact with the repository using the command line, create a webpage with html and css along with using Bootstrap.
	<br>We also had a list of requirments for our webpage.
	<br>For my website I had the idea of creating a website for a traveling agency.
	<br>The pages I created included a home page, a page that shows different locations, and a page that shows the travel rates.
	<br>I used this <a href = "https://www.taniarascia.com/adding-syntax-highlighting-to-code-snippets/"> page</a> to learn how to do syntax highlighting easier.

			Creating the Repository
		</div>
This part required me to create a GitHub repository and learn how to do things such as being able add and commit files from the command line.
<br> At first I used this <a href = "https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line"> page </a> to learn how to start.
<br> I then followed these steps.
	<ol>
		<li>Created a new repository manually in GitHub.</li>
		<li>Used the command <code>git init</code> to initialize the repository in the correct folder.</li>
		<li>Used the command <code>git add .</code> to add the files to stage them for commiting.</li>
		<li>Used the command <code>git commit -m "First commit" </code> to commit the files that I staged.</li>
		<li>Found my repository's url in the setup page of my repository. (https://omegaarmadillo.github.io/CS-460-Test/)</li>
		<li>Used the command <code>git remote add origin https://omegaarmadillo.github.io/CS-460-Test/</code> to set a new remote.</li>
		<li>Used the command <code>git remote -v</code> to verify the remote.</li>
		<li>Finally I used the command <code>git push origin master</code> to push the code to the repository.</li>
	</ol>
 I also learned about the uses of the pull command.
<br> I had to use it after I had edited and deleted some files in my repository and tried to push files. 	
<br> I then got the error "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you donot have locally". 
<br> After I got this error I did some research and learned I had to use <code>git pull origin master</code> to fix the issue before I could push to the repository.

		<div class = "hwTitle">
			Creating the Webpage
		</div>
	
		For this part there were these were the things that were required
		<ol>
			<li>You must use Bootstrap (v4) for the layout of all pages and must demonstrate both single column layout and two or more column formatting</li>
			<li>You must have a separate CSS file (e.g. styles.css) in which you write some of your own classes and that you use somewhere</li>
			<li>You'll need a navigation bar or menu that contains links to all your pages</li>
			<li>You need to have at least one table and at least two kinds of lists: ol, ul and dl</li>
		</ol>

		<div class = "hwSubTitle">
		1. Implementing Bootstrap
		</div>
		To implement Bootstrap I had to add this code to the webpage.
		<br> <code> &#60; link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T" crossorigin="anonymous" &#62; </code>
		<br> I decided to use Bootstrap to make a carousel.
		<br> For this I used and example from https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=bootstrap&file=carousel
		<br> For this I had to add <code> &#60;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js">&#60;/script> </code> and
 <code> &#60;script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js">&#60;/script> </code></code>
		<br> The code I used is

	
	</p>



<pre><code class = "language-markup">
		&#60;div class = "sightPicDiv">
		
			&#60;div id = "sightCarousel" class = "carousel slide" data-ride = "carousel" data-interval = "4000" >

				&#60;div class="carousel-inner">
					&#60;div class="carousel-item active">
						&#60;img src="Images/beach.jpg" alt="beach 1" style="width:85%;">
					&#60;/div>

					&#60;div class="carousel-item">
						&#60;img src="Images/beach2.jpg" alt="beach 2" style="width:85%;">
					&#60;/div>
    
					&#60;div class="carousel-item">
						&#60;img src="Images/beach3.jpg" alt="beach 3" style="width:85%;">
					&#60;/div>
	
				&#60;/div>
		
			&#60;/div>
				
		&#60;/div>

</code>
</pre>


This is the CSS

<pre>
<code class = "language-css">
#sightCarousel
{
	float:right;
	width: 80%;
}
</code>
</pre>



	<p>

		<div class = "hwSubTitle">
	<br>	2. Have a seperate CSS file for styles and create your own classes
		</div>
		
		This part was relatively simple.
		<br> I started by creating a css file called HW1.css
		<br> For each page I added <code>	&#60; link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="CSS\HW1.css" &#62; </code> to link the style sheet to the page.
		<br> Here are some examples of the classes I created.
		
		
		<pre><code class = "language-css">	
		
*
{
	font-family: "Palatino"
}



a:visited {
  color: white;
}

.titleBox
{
	color: white;
	font-size: 50px;
	background-color: MediumBlue;
	width: 100%;
}



.sun
{
	height: 70px;
	width: 70px;
	background-color: yellow;
	border-radius: 50%;

	float: left;

}
	</code></pre>

	</p>
	
	<p>
	
		<div class = "hwSubTitle">
		<br>	3. Create a navigation bar
		</div>
	
		For this I decided to use an unordered list as a navigation bar so i could fufill two requirements.
		<br>This is my code

	

		
<pre><code class = "language-markup">		
		&#60;div class = "navMenu">
		&#60;ul class = "navMenuList">
		
			&#60;li class = "navMenuListItem"> &#60;a href = "HW1_Sights.html"> Sights &#60;/a> &#60;/li>
			&#60;li class = "navMenuListItem"> &#60;a href = "HW1_Rates.html"> Rates &#60;/a> &#60;/li>
		
		&#60;/ul>
	&#60;/div>	
</code></pre>		
		

	<br>These are the styles I created
<pre><code class = "language-css">		

		
.navMenu
{
	text-align: center;
	color: white;
	background-color: GoldenRod;
	height: 40px;

}



.navMenuList
{

	list-style-type: none;
	
}


.navMenuListItem
{
	float: left;
	margin:0 0 0 50px;
	font-size: 20px;
}
	
</code></pre>

	<br>I decided to use this many classes so I could have a wide range of control when creating the website.
	<br>I found that using a list was easier than making a bunch of divs as I din't have to worry about messing with the width of each of the divs.
	<br>All I had to do was use the float:left to achieve a similiar look.
	<br>

</p>


<p>
		<div class = "hwSubTitle">
		<br>	4. Table and ordered list
		</div>
For my ordered list I used it a a way to mark the popularity of different sights
<br> Here is the code for my list
<pre><code class = "language-markup">		
		&#60;ol class = "sightList">
			&#60;li class = "sightListItem"> Beach 1&#60;/li>
			&#60;li class = "sightListItem"> Beach 2 &#60;/li>
			&#60;li class = "sightListItem"> Beach 3 &#60;/li>
	
		&#60;/ol>
</code></pre>

Here is the css
<pre><code class = "language-css">		
.sightListDiv
{
	width: 20%;
	float: left;
	background-color: GoldenRod;
	border-right: 10px solid MediumBlue;
	text-align: center;
	font-size: 25px;


}


.sightList
{
	height: 565px;

}


.sightListItem
{
	border: 3px solid GoldenRod;
	background-color: MediumBlue;
	width: 100%;
	height: 50px;
	float: left;
	text-align: center;
	font-size: 30px;
	color: white;
	/*border-radius:50%;
	margin:0 0 20px 0; */
	
}

</code></pre>

With the list and the Bootstrap carousel this makes the page a multi-column format.
<br> The home page fills the single column format.

<br> The table I made a table of the different rates for travel.


<pre><code class = "language-markup">		
			&#60;table>
		
			&#60;tr>
				&#60;th>Location&#60;/th>
				&#60;th>Description&#60;/th>
				&#60;th>Cost&#60;/th>
			&#60;/tr>
			
			&#60;tr>
				&#60;td>Hawaii&#60;/td>
				&#60;td>A vacation classic&#60;/td>
				&#60;td>100$/day&#60;/td>
			
			&#60;/tr>
			
			&#60;tr>
				&#60;td>Caribbean&#60;/td>
				&#60;td>An area with many sights&#60;/td>
				&#60;td>150$/day&#60;/td>
			&#60;/tr>
		
			&#60;tr>
				&#60;td>New Zealand&#60;/td>
				&#60;td>A more exotic trip&#60;/td>
				&#60;td>200$/day&#60;/td>
			&#60;/tr>
		
		&#60;/table>
</code></pre>
The css for the table is


<pre><code class = "language-css">	
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
  font-size: 30px;
  width: 100%;
}
</code></pre>
