	CS460 Project 2: Bootstrap Grid, JavaScript, and JQuery
	</div>

	<div>
		This page contains information about my project 2.
		<br> This project had us using Bootstrap's row and column abilities to create the layout of the webpage.
		<br> We also had to use JavaScript and JQuery to get input from the user and display some sort of result.
		<br> For my website I did a sort of survey that takes numerical information from the user and creates a color for them based on their input.
		<br> For this I have a single homepage and a css file.
	</div>
