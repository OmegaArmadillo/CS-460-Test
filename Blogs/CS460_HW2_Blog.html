	CS460 Project 2: Bootstrap Grid, JavaScript, and JQuery
	</div>

	<div>
		This page contains information about my project 2.
		<br> This project had us using Bootstrap's row and column abilities to create the layout of the webpage.
		<br> We also had to use JavaScript and JQuery to get input from the user and display some sort of result.
		<br> For my website I did a sort of survey that takes numerical information from the user and creates a color for them based on their input.
		<br> For this I have a single homepage and a css file.
	</div>
	
		Here is the final design of the website and a link to it. <a href = "../HW2/CS460_HW2.html"> HW2 Page </a>
		<br><img src = "HW2_Images/Website.png" style = "width:60%;">	
	
	

	<p>
		<div class = "hwTitle">
			Initial setup
		</div>

		For the intial branch setup I went through the added the branch throught the github repository.
		<br> I also created a new html with the bootstrap links added and css file.


	</p>
	
	
	<p>
		<div class = "hwTitle">
			Planning and Design
		</div>
		
		This image shows my initial design for the project.
		<br> Many things did change like adding an extra column to each of the rows.
		<br> I also added a row to the the container fluid because the progress bar was not appearing in the middle of the contianer.
		<br> Using the row and making it center fixed this problem.		
		<br><img src = "HW2_Images/Wireframe.png" style = "width:60%;">
		
	
	</p>
	
	
	<p>
		<div class = "hwTitle">
			Coding
		</div>

		The first important part of the webpage is how i structured my questions
		<br> The way they are structured is important for the code I have to work
		<br> An example of a column is
		
		<pre> <code class = "language-markup">
		<script type = "prism-html-markup">
		
				
				<div class = "row">
				
					<div class = "col-md-auto">
						Q1
					</div>
				
					<div class = "col" name = "question">
						How old are you?
					</div>
				
					<div class = "col" name = "answer">
				
						<input type="text" name = "text" placeholder="Search..">
						<button type = "button" onclick = "submitQuestion(currentQuestion)">submit</button>
						
					</div>
						
				</div>		
		
		
		</script>
		</code></pre>
		
		
		The last row is different and looks like this
		
		
		<pre> <code class = "language-markup">
		<script type = "prism-html-markup">
		
		<div class = "row" >
			
			<div class = "col" name = "answer" style = "visibility:hidden; text-align:center;">
				
				Create your Color
				<div class="w-100"></div>
					<button type = "button" onclick = "createColor()">submit</button>		
				</div>		
		</div>
		
		</script>
		</code></pre>


		The code also ties into the progress bar that looks like this
		
		<pre> <code class = "language-markup">
		<script type = "prism-html-markup">		
		
	<div class = "container-fluid progressBox">
		<div class="row align-items-center" style = "height:50px">
			<div class="col">
				<div class="progress">
					<div class="progress-bar" name = "completion" role="progressbar" style = "width:0%;" aria-valuenow="0" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100">0%</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
		
		</script>
		</code></pre>	

	
		Here is the code that works for the first five questions
		<br>currentQuestion keeps track of what queation the user is on, answers keep track of the users answers to questions, and barProgress is used to update the progress bar when a quesiton is answered.
		<br>All of the columns that have the question text are named question.
		<br>All of the columns that have the text field and submit button are named answer.
		<br>All of the text fields for the answer are named text.
		<br>I did this so I could use one function for all of the questions as I knew what was where, what the order was, and what question the user would be on.
		<br>First it will get the input that user typed in to the text field.
		<br>It will then check if the input is an integer, if it is the code continues otherwise an error message is shown and the user must try a different.
		<br>First it saves the answer to the current question in the correct array spot.
		<br>For the current question it sets the question text to say "Done" and makes the button and text field hidden so the user cannot answer the same quesion twice.
		<br>The button and text field for the next question become visible.
		<br>The width of the progress bar and the value update.
		<br>The final time that the code runs will instead maake the "create your color" button appear in the final row
		<pre> <code class = "language-javascript">

	/*keeps track of what question the user is on*/
	var currentQuestion = 0;
	
	/*holds the answers to the questions*/
	var answers = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0];
	
	/*keeps track of the current value of the progress bar*/
	var barProgress = 0;
	
  /*function used when the submit button of an answer is pressed*/
  function submitQuestion(currentQuestion)
  {
	/*save the answer to the question*/
	var test = $("[name = text]")[currentQuestion].value;
	
	/*tests to see if the value is an integer*/
	if(Number.isInteger(+test))
	{
	 	/*saves the answer into the answer array*/ 	
		answers[currentQuestion] = $("[name = text]")[currentQuestion].value;
	
		/*makes the text field and button for the current question hidden*/
		var xA = $("[name = answer]")[currentQuestion];
		xA.style.visibility = 'hidden';
	
		/*makes the questio text for the current question say "Done"*/
		var xQ = $("[name = question]")[currentQuestion];
		xQ.innerHTML = "Done";

		/*updates the current question*/
		currentQuestion = currentQuestion + 1;

		/*makes the next question's text field and button visible*/
		var y = $("[name = answer]")[currentQuestion];
		y.style.visibility = 'visible';
	
		/*updates the text and width of the progress bar*/
		var bar = $("[name = completion]")[0];
		bar.setAttribute('style','width:' + (barProgress + 20) + '%');
		barProgress = barProgress + 20;
		bar.innerHTML = barProgress + "%";
	 
	}
	else
	{
		/*alerts the user if the value is not valid*/
		alert('Input must be a number');	
	}
	
  }

		</code></pre>		

	Here is the html for the boxes that appear after the last queestion is answered .
	<br> These are important for understanding the last piece of code.

		<pre> <code class = "language-markup">
		<script type = "prism-html-markup">	

	<div name = "final" style = "visibility:hidden;">
		<div class = "container showBox">
			Here is your very own spirit color.
		</div>	
		
		<div class = " container colorBox" name = "coloredBox">
		</div>		
		
	</div>


		</script>
		</code></pre>

	This is the code that runs when the "create your color" button is pressed.
	<br>First it does all of the calculations to determine the r, g, and b values for the color.
	<br>It then makes sure that all of the values are between 0 and 255.
	<br>It then changes the background color of the color box to the calculated color.
	<br>Finally it makes the last two boxes visible.
	
		<pre> <code class = "language-javascript">

  function createColor ()
  {
	/*calculates the r, g, and b values based on the user's answers*/
	var r = (answers[3]*10) + (answers[4]*10);
	
	var g = (answers[1] * answers[2]) - 100;
	
	var b = 255 - (answers[0]*2);
	
	/*makes sure that the r, g, and b values are in the correct range*/
	if (r > 255)
	{
		r = 255;
	}
	if (g > 255)
	{
		g = 255;
	}
	if (b > 255)
	{
		b = 255;
	}
	
	if (r < 0)
	{
		r = 0;
	}
	if (g < 0)
	{
		g = 0;
	}
	if (b < 0)
	{
		b = 0;
	}
	
	<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14323082/why-doesnt-backgroundcolor-rgba-b-c-work -->
	/*sets the background color of the final box to be the calculated color*/
	var box = $("[name = coloredBox]")[0];
	box.style.backgroundColor = 'rgb(' + r + ',' + g + ',' + b + ')';
	
	/*makes the final box visible*/
	var x = $("[name = final]")[0];
	x.style.visibility = 'visible';
